# miniRT
This project is about creating a basic ray tracing engine in C. The purpose is to render simple Computer-Generated-Images.

##  Description

The goal of miniRT program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system..

Authorized functions for the assignment: `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `perror`, `strerror`, `exit` as well as all lib math functions;

## Usage

Run `make` in the root of the projet and launch as follows:

```
./miniRT [scene.rt]

```

Run `make bonus` to add the bonus features such [Phong reflexion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model "Phong reflexion model"), cones and texture mapping:

```
./miniRT_bonus [scene.rt]

```
